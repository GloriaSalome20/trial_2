### Group Work for Live Coding

Over the course of this workshop, you will collaborate with your peers
in small groups to develop a short lesson from start to finish. This
includes how to identify your target audience, determine what content to
teach, and create an assessment-based curriculum for that content.
Because much of our work involves programming, you will also learn how
to effectively teach using the live coding method. Over the last two
days of the session, groups will lead the class through their short
lesson and receive feedback. 

Take some time today or tomorrow to create a group of two people. Make
sure all of your are familiar with the same programming language (R).
Begin to think about something you really enjoy about your
programming language that you might like to share with others. Whatever
it is, it must be *small*! Examples include:

-   how to make a specific type of plot (line, scatter, bar, etc)
-   how to customize the color scheme of a plot
-   how to convert from one date-time type to another
-   how a single function can help solve a common data cleaning problem

In the coming days, you and your group will decide on a specific thing
you'd like to teach and begin building your curriculum from there.

Over the course of the workshop, when you see a section labeled **Group
Work**, it's a sign for you to assemble with your group members to
develop a new part of your curriculum.

On Friday, each group will take us through
their lesson. You will have **30 minutes total** to introduce your
topic, teach it with live coding, and deliver a brief assessment.
Afterwards we will have 10 minutes of feedback before moving on to the
next group. This is a short amount of time, so the topic of your
curriculum must be very concise. We will work together to pick an
appropriate topic for each group.

## Learning Objectives

After attending this training, participants will be able to:

-   teach with a growth mindset, and encourage a growth mindset in
    students;
-   comfortably lead live coding sessions;
-   design lessons and assessments using the principles of backward
    design.

## Prerequisites

Before joining this training, participants should:

-   have the latest versions of [R and
    RStudio](https://bertozzivill.github.io/r-install-instructions)
    installed (see below).
-   have some familiarity with programming in R, especially
    making plots in either language.

## Software Setup

Please make sure you have a stable internet connection, then follow
these steps:

### R and RStudio

If you have not already done so, please follow the [R setup
instructions](https://bertozzivill.github.io/r-install-instructions) to
download or update your R and RStudio.


### R Packages Needed

Please make sure you have installed the `tidyverse` package in R by
running the the `install.packages("tidyverse")` in the console.



## Acknowledgment

This lesson was built using [The Carpentries
Workbench][carpentries-workbench] by Amelia Bertozzi-Villa and Punam
Amratia. Much material was adapted from the Carpentries courses
[Collaborative Lesson Development Training][lesson-dev] and [Instructor
Training][instructor-training], while other material is original.
